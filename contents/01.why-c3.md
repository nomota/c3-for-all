# Why C3? There're Rust, Zig, Odin already.

## Why C3?

C3 is a modern successor of C, preserving the C syntax as much as possible, so that existing C/C++ developers may enjoy the modern advancements of programming languages, without extra learning. C language is universally taught to all Computer Science students, C is virtually the only choice in embedded programming, and a huge code base of C is still evolving everywhere. Staying close to C is inevitable choice.
