# Strings

C3 provides multiple string types.

* `String` which is mapped to `char[]`, used as the basic string type
* `ZString` which is mapped to `char*`, used for C interoperability
* `WString` which is mapped to `Char16*`, used for Windows interoperability
* `DString` is a dynamic string similar to `StringBuilder` in Java, `std::string` in C++

### String type

`String` type is most used type in C3, which is defined as follows.

```c3
typedef String = inline char[];
```

Within layout of memory, `String` is exactly same as `char[]`, which means it's length is fixed at first as `.len` field.

It's a 'distinct' type, not an alias to `char[]`, so it needs type cast to convert to and from. 

```c3
char[] a = "abc";
String b = "def";
String c = a; // no need to cast (String) because it's inlined in typedef
char[] d = (char[]) b; // type cast is necessary because they are distinct types
```
