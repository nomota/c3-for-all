# Strings

C3 provides multiple string types.

* `String` which is mapped to `char[]`, used as the basic string type
* `ZString` which is mapped to `char*`, used for C interoperability
* `WString` which is mapped to `Char16*`, used for Windows interoperability
* `DString` is a dynamic string similar to `StringBuilder` in Java, `std::string` in C++

### String type

`String` type is most used type in C3, which is defined as follows.

```c3
typedef String = inline char[];
```

Within layout of memory, `String` is exactly same as `char[]`, which means its length is fixed at first as `.len` field.

It's a 'distinct' type, not an alias to `char[]`, so it needs type casting to convert to and from. 

```c3
char[] a = "abc-utf8-encoded";
String b = "def-utf8-encoded";
String c = (String)a; // needs type casting, because it's distinct type
char[] d = b; // no need to cast (char[]) because it's inlined in typedef
assert(d.len == b.len);
```

* Note: all strings in C3 are by default UTF-8 encoded,and so is C3 source code and string literals ("") in it.

* Note: string literals are zero(`'\0'`) ended just like in C, but `String` and `char[]` do not end with zero.

```c3
char[5] h = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};
char[] x = &h; // array to slice
String y = (String)h[..]; // array to slice to String
assert(y == "Hello");
char* z = &h;

io::printfn("%s", h); // prints [72, 101, 108, 108, 111]                      [
```
